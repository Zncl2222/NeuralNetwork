# NeuralNetwork Project

This project is a personal practice aimed at implementing a neural network from
scratch. The ultimate goal is to develop it into a robust framework similar
to PyTorch.

## Plans & Goals

1. Basic Implementation ðŸ“Œ (Current State)

    Implement a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy. Focus on functionality over structure.

2. Framework Development

    Transform the initial implementation into a structured framework, similar to PyTorch and TensorFlow.

3. Feature Enhancement

    Optimize the code and implement additional features such as different
    activation functions, loss functions, and other neural network-related
    components.

4. Multilingual Implementation

    Implement the framework in other languages such as C, C++, Go, and Rust.
